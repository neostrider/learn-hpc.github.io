## Welcome to "HPC, as an identity"!

This initiative is of the belief that more and more engineers should make High Performance Computing (HPC) as one of their core skills. They may be computational physicists, machine learning scientists/engineers etc etc. The list may very well cover the entire spectrum of professsions in the world now. Along with this core topic of theirs, it will be great if they make themselves proficient at HPC. We believe that engineers with this combination of skills, will have a productive and sustainable career path.
